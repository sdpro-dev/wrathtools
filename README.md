# Tools of Wrath
MVC framework built on Symfony components/Vanilla PHP
--
Base framework to be used in my upcoming tools deployment, will be using it as my personal CMS for:
  * Client Media
  * Python Scripts
  * Code Snippits
  * Music
  * Poetry
  * Contacts
  * Whatever


And yes I know I could just use a boxed CMS, but I would rather write one for the fun, and because I can :)
